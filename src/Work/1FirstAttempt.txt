Round 1 turns all the bulbs on since all are divisible by one.
Which ones will remain on by the time bulb 100 is reached?

The bulbs that will be on are those with an even number of factors less than 100.
The bulbs that will be off are those with an odd number of factors less than 100.

With even number of factors, the bulb will always end up being off.
2 factors? On, then off. 4? On, off, on, then off. And so on.

With odd number of factors, the bulb will always end up being on.
3 factors? On, then off, then on. 5? On, off, on, off, on. And so on.

For example, the factors of 2 are (1, 2). Even number of factors.
Bulb two will be turned on by person 1, then off by person 2.

Same with 3: (1, 3). It will be turned on by person 1, then off by person 3.

Now 4: (1, 2, 4) has 3 factors. It will be turned on, off, and on again.

Once a number is passed, its state is set.
4 will not be revisited after person 4 comes in, because next people will flip multiples of 5, 6, etc.

So, let's determine how many odd and even factored numbers there are between 1-100:
