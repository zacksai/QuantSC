Here's the full thought process:

Bulbs can be toggled an even or odd number of times.

Even means they'll be off in the end, and odd means they'll be on. Example:
2 toggles: on, off.
3 toggles: on, off, on.

How many times will a bulb be toggled? When its factors are toggled. Example:

Bulb 6 factors into 1, 2, 3, 6.
So person 1, 2, 3, 6 will toggle bulb 6 since they're all multiples of 6.
Person 4 and 5 won't toggle it cause 6 isn't a multiple of 4 or 5:
    Person 1: on
    Person 2: off
    Person 3: on
    Person 4: nothing
    Person 5: nothing
    Person 6: off.
    Person 7+: nothing (never a factor of 6)

So the factors determine how many times the bulb is toggled.
If the bulb number has an even number of factors, it will end up off.
If the bulb number has an odd number of factors, it will end up on.

When does a number have an odd number of factors?
Let's check prime numbers, even numbers, and odd numbers:

Prime numbers are divisible by 1 and themselves. Just those two. Always even.

Even numbers are divisible by 1, themselves, and other even numbers.
    2: (1, 2) – even
    4: (1, 2, 4) – odd
    6: (1, 2, 3, 6) – even
    8: (1, 2, 4, 8) – even
That's always even, except for 4, 16, etc...

Odd numbers are divisible by 1, themselves, and other odd numbers.
    3: (1, 3) – even
    5: (1, 5) – even
    7: (1, 7) – even
    9: (1, 3, 9) – odd
That's always even, except for 9, 25, etc...

The pattern to the exception? The number must be a square.

Typically, factors go in pairs since they're two separate numbers.
However, squares can divide into a single number multiplied by itself.
That's just one factor, not a pair.
So squares add one factor to an otherwise even number of factors.
One plus even is odd.
Found it!

All the squares have an odd number of factors, so they'll end up toggled on.

What are all the squares from 1-100?
1, 4, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.
That's 10 bulbs that go on, off, (repeat some number of times,) and finally on again.
The rest of the bulbs will always end up switching off. Always an even number of factors.

So only 10 bulbs will be on at the end.
